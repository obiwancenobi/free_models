# Dynamic Web App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Responsive Design
The application must adapt seamlessly to all device sizes and screen resolutions, ensuring optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This principle ensures accessibility and usability for all users.

### Performance Optimization
Prioritize fast loading times, efficient resource usage, and smooth interactions. Implement lazy loading, caching, and code splitting to maintain high performance standards.

### Security First
Implement robust security measures including data encryption, secure authentication, and protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF. All user data must be handled securely.

### User-Centric Experience
Focus on intuitive navigation, clear user interfaces, and engaging interactions. Conduct user testing and iterate based on feedback to enhance usability.

### Scalability and Maintainability
Design the application to handle growth in users and data. Use modular architecture, clean code practices, and comprehensive documentation for long-term maintainability.

## Technical Standards

Use modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, and frameworks like React or Vue.js. Ensure compliance with web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) and performance benchmarks (e.g., Lighthouse scores above 90).

## Development Workflow

Follow agile methodologies with regular code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration. Use version control with Git, implement CI/CD pipelines, and maintain comprehensive documentation.

## Governance

The constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require approval from the development team and must be documented. All pull requests must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified, and use this constitution for runtime development guidance.
