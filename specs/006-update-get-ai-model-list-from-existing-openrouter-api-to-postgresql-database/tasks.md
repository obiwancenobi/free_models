# Tasks: PostgreSQL Integration with Cache-First Approach

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-update-get-ai-model-list-from-existing-openrouter-api-to-postgresql-database/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/` based on plan.md
- All paths relative to repository root

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Add PostgreSQL client dependency to backend/package.json
- [ ] T002 [P] Create environment configuration for database connection in backend/.env.example
- [ ] T003 [P] Update .gitignore with database credentials pattern

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test GET /api/models in backend/tests/contract/test-models-api.js
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/models/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test-models-id.js
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test cache-first data retrieval in backend/tests/integration/test-cache-database-fallback.js
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test database fallback scenario in backend/tests/integration/test-database-fallback.js
- [ ] T008 [P] Integration test API fallback scenario in backend/tests/integration/test-api-fallback.js
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test database connectivity error handling in backend/tests/integration/test-database-errors.js

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T010 [P] DatabaseService class in backend/src/services/databaseService.js
- [ ] T011 [P] Database connection configuration in backend/src/config/database.js
- [ ] T012 Update ModelService to implement cache-first with database fallback in backend/src/services/modelService.js
- [ ] T013 [P] Database model for AI models in backend/src/models/aiModel.js
- [ ] T014 [P] Database migration script in backend/src/database/migrations/001_create_ai_models.js
- [ ] T015 [P] Database health check endpoint in backend/src/routes/health.js

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T016 Connect ModelService to database operations
- [ ] T017 Implement graceful error handling for database failures
- [ ] T018 Add database connection monitoring and logging
- [ ] T019 Update cache service integration with database layer
- [ ] T020 Add database connection retry logic with exponential backoff

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T021 [P] Unit tests for DatabaseService in backend/tests/unit/test-databaseService.js
- [ ] T022 [P] Unit tests for updated ModelService in backend/tests/unit/test-modelService.js
- [ ] T023 Performance tests for cache-first implementation (<50ms cache hits)
- [ ] T024 [P] Update API documentation in specs/006-update-get-ai-model-list-from-existing-openrouter-api-to-postgresql-database/contracts/
- [ ] T025 Integration test data persistence across application restarts
- [ ] T026 Remove any debugging code and console.logs

## Dependencies
- T001 blocks T010, T011, T013, T014 (database dependency needed)
- T004-T009 block T010-T015 (tests before implementation - TDD)
- T010 blocks T016, T019 (DatabaseService before integration)
- T011 blocks T016, T018 (database config before connection)
- T012 blocks T016, T017, T019 (ModelService before integration)
- T013 blocks T010, T016 (model before service)
- T014 blocks T010, T016 (migration before database operations)
- T016-T020 block T021-T026 (implementation before polish tests)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch independent setup tasks together:
Task: "Add PostgreSQL client dependency to backend/package.json"
Task: "Create environment configuration for database connection in backend/.env.example"
Task: "Update .gitignore with database credentials pattern"

# Launch contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test GET /api/models in backend/tests/contract/test-models-api.js"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/models/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test-models-id.js"
Task: "Integration test cache-first data retrieval in backend/tests/integration/test-cache-database-fallback.js"
```

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - models-api.md → contract test tasks T004, T005 [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation tasks T012, T015

2. **From Data Model**:
   - AI Model entity → database model task T013 [P]
   - Database schema → migration task T014 [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks T010, T012

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Cache-first retrieval → integration tests T006, T007, T008 [P]
   - Database fallback → integration test T009 [P]
   - Error handling → integration test T009 [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T005)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T013)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T009 before T010-T015)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/services)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

---

**Total Tasks**: 26 tasks | **Estimated Effort**: 15-20 hours
**Parallel Potential**: 40% of tasks can run in parallel
**Critical Path**: T001 → T004-T009 → T010-T015 → T016-T020 → T021-T026

**Ready for Execution**: All tasks are specific, ordered, and include exact file paths for immediate implementation.
