# Feature Specification: Update AI Model List Storage with PostgreSQL Database

**Feature Branch**: `006-update-get-ai-model-list-from-existing-openrouter-api-to-postgresql-database`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update get ai model list from existing openrouter api to postgresql database"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to access a reliable and up-to-date list of free AI models from OpenRouter, with the system providing fast response times through caching while ensuring data persistence across application restarts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application starts for the first time, **When** a user requests the model list, **Then** the system fetches fresh data from OpenRouter API, stores it in the database, caches it in memory, and returns the list to the user
2. **Given** the in-memory cache contains valid model data, **When** a user requests the model list, **Then** the system serves data from cache and returns the list without accessing the database or API
3. **Given** the cache has expired but database contains model data, **When** a user requests the model list, **Then** the system serves data from database, refreshes the cache, and returns the list
4. **Given** both cache and database are unavailable/empty, **When** a user requests the model list, **Then** the system fetches fresh data from OpenRouter API, stores it in database, caches it, and serves the updated list

### Edge Cases
- What happens when database connection fails but cache is available?
- How does system handle partial data updates from OpenRouter API?
- What occurs when OpenRouter API is unavailable but database has stale data?
- How should the system handle database schema changes or migrations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST store AI model data in PostgreSQL database for persistence across application restarts
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain existing in-memory cache functionality as the primary performance mechanism
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement a data retrieval hierarchy: cache first, then database, then API as fallback
- **FR-004**: System MUST synchronize data between OpenRouter API and database when both cache and database miss
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing cache TTL and refresh mechanisms
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle database connection failures gracefully without breaking cache functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain existing API filtering for free models only
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide data consistency between database and cache layers

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AI Model**: Represents an AI model from OpenRouter with attributes including unique identifier, name, description, pricing information, and metadata
- **Model Collection**: Represents the complete set of free AI models available at any given time, stored persistently in database and cached in memory
