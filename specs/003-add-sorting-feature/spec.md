# Feature Specification: Add Sorting Feature

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-sorting-feature`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add sorting feature, sort by : created date & context length"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing the list of free AI models, I want to sort the models by their created date and context length so that I can easily find models that fit my specific needs, such as preferring newer models or those with longer context windows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a list of models is displayed, **When** the user selects "Sort by Created Date (Newest First)", **Then** the models are reordered with the most recently created models at the top.
2. **Given** a list of models is displayed, **When** the user selects "Sort by Created Date (Oldest First)", **Then** the models are reordered with the oldest created models at the top.
3. **Given** a list of models is displayed, **When** the user selects "Sort by Context Length (Highest First)", **Then** the models are reordered with models having the largest context length at the top.
4. **Given** a list of models is displayed, **When** the user selects "Sort by Context Length (Lowest First)", **Then** the models are reordered with models having the smallest context length at the top.
5. **Given** a sorted list of models, **When** the user performs a search, **Then** the search results maintain the current sort order.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple models have the same created date? (Secondary sort by name alphabetically)
- How does the system handle models without a created date? (Treat as oldest or exclude from sorting)
- What if context length is not available? (Exclude from sorting or treat as 0)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a sorting dropdown or buttons allowing users to select sort criteria (created date ascending/descending, context length ascending/descending)
- **FR-002**: The system MUST sort models by created date when selected, with options for newest first or oldest first
- **FR-003**: The system MUST sort models by context length when selected, with options for highest first or lowest first
- **FR-004**: The system MUST display the current sort option clearly to the user
- **FR-005**: The system MUST preserve the sort order when filtering/searching models
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle models with missing created date or context length gracefully

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Model**: Represents an AI model with attributes including id, name, created date, context length, and other metadata
