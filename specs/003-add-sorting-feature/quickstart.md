# Quick Start: Add Sorting Feature

**Feature**: Add Sorting Feature  
**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Target Users**: End users of the free models application

## Overview

The sorting feature allows you to organize the model list by created date or context length using icon buttons located next to the search input field.

## How to Use Sorting

### Accessing Sort Options
1. Navigate to the models list page
2. Look for two icon buttons to the right of the search input field:
   - üìÖ **Date Sort Button**: Sort by model creation date
   - üìè **Context Sort Button**: Sort by context length

### Sorting by Created Date
- **First Click**: Sort by newest first (most recent models at top)
- **Second Click**: Sort by oldest first (oldest models at top)
- **Visual Indicator**: Button highlights when active

### Sorting by Context Length
- **First Click**: Sort by highest context first (largest context windows at top)
- **Second Click**: Sort by lowest context first (smallest context windows at top)
- **Visual Indicator**: Button highlights when active

### Combined Usage with Search
1. Enter a search term in the search box
2. The results will be filtered first
3. Then sorted according to your selected sort option
4. Change sort order to reorganize the filtered results

## Examples

### Example 1: Finding Recent Models
```
1. Click the date sort button once (newest first)
2. Browse the top models for the most recently created ones
3. Use search to filter by provider if needed
```

### Example 2: Finding High-Context Models
```
1. Click the context sort button once (highest first)
2. Look at models with large context windows (8192+ tokens)
3. Search for specific model names to compare
```

### Example 3: Finding Older Reliable Models
```
1. Click the date sort button twice (oldest first)
2. Scroll to see well-established models
3. Use context sort if you need specific context requirements
```

## Expected Behavior

### Visual Feedback
- Active sort button is highlighted
- Sort order indicated by arrow direction (up = ascending, down = descending)
- Tooltips appear on hover: "Sort by date", "Sort by context length"

### Performance
- Sorting happens instantly for typical model counts (<1000)
- No page refresh required
- Sort state persists during search

### Edge Cases
- Models without creation dates appear at the bottom (oldest)
- Models without context length appear at the bottom (lowest)
- Empty search results maintain sort settings

## Troubleshooting

### Sort Not Working
- Check if models are loaded (wait for loading indicator to disappear)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Unexpected Sort Order
- Some models may not have creation dates
- Context length of 0 means unlimited or unknown
- Sort is case-insensitive for text fields

### Mobile Usage
- Buttons stack vertically on small screens
- Touch targets are appropriately sized
- Same functionality as desktop
