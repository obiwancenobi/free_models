# Research: Enable Cache on Backend Side

## Overview
This research phase addresses the unknowns identified in the Technical Context for implementing caching on the backend side with 5-minute expiration.

## Research Findings

### Caching Library Choice
**Decision**: Use `node-cache` for in-memory caching
**Rationale**:
- Simple and lightweight in-memory cache for Node.js
- No external dependencies required
- Supports TTL (time-to-live) for automatic expiration
- Suitable for single-instance deployment
- Easy integration with Express middleware
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redis: More robust for multi-instance deployments, but requires external service and is overkill for this use case
- memory-cache: Similar functionality but less actively maintained
- lru-cache: Good alternative, but node-cache has better documentation for Express integration

### Cache Invalidation Strategies
**Decision**: Implement both automatic expiration and manual invalidation
**Rationale**:
- Automatic expiration ensures data freshness within 5-minute window
- Manual invalidation via admin endpoint allows immediate cache clearing when needed
- Combination provides flexibility for different scenarios
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Only automatic expiration: Lacks control for immediate updates
- Only manual invalidation: Requires constant monitoring and manual intervention

### Memory Usage Considerations
**Decision**: Implement cache size limits and monitoring
**Rationale**:
- Prevents memory leaks in long-running applications
- Sets reasonable limits based on expected data volume
- Includes monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Unlimited cache: Risk of memory exhaustion
- No monitoring: Lack of visibility into cache performance

### Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use Express middleware for cache layer
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of caching logic from business logic
- Easy to enable/disable per route
- Consistent caching behavior across endpoints
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct integration in service methods: Tighter coupling, harder to test
- Cache-aside pattern in controllers: More boilerplate code

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Cache Service**: Create a dedicated cache service using node-cache
2. **Middleware**: Implement Express middleware for automatic caching
3. **Configuration**: Set 5-minute TTL, reasonable size limits
4. **Monitoring**: Add cache statistics logging
5. **Testing**: Include cache-specific test scenarios

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and set limits to prevent issues
- **Cache Staleness**: 5-minute expiration balances freshness and performance
- **Concurrent Access**: node-cache handles concurrent operations safely
- **Deployment**: Single-instance assumption simplifies consistency

## Conclusion
The research confirms node-cache as the appropriate choice for this implementation. All unknowns have been resolved, and the approach aligns with performance optimization principles from the constitution.
