# Feature Specification: Enable Cache on Backend Side

**Feature Branch**: `004-enable-cache-on`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "enable cache on backend side, with cache expiration = 5 minutes"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (API users), actions (cache responses), data (models data), constraints (5 min expiration)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an API consumer, I want the backend to cache responses for models data so that repeated requests are served faster, reducing external API calls and improving response times.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a request for models data, **When** the data is cached and within 5 minutes of caching, **Then** the system returns the cached data without making an external API call.
2. **Given** a request for models data, **When** the cache is expired (older than 5 minutes) or empty, **Then** the system fetches fresh data from the external API, caches it, and returns it.
3. **Given** a request for a specific model by ID, **When** the model data is cached and not expired, **Then** the system returns the cached model data.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the cache storage is full and new data needs to be cached?
- How does the system handle cache expiration during a high-traffic period?
- What if the external API is unavailable when cache is expired?
- For single-instance deployment (recommended for this project), cache consistency is automatic as there's only one cache. For multi-instance deployment, implement distributed cache with node-cache for consistency.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST cache responses from the models API endpoints.
- **FR-002**: Cache expiration MUST be set to exactly 5 minutes from the time data is cached.
- **FR-003**: System MUST serve cached data when available and not expired, bypassing external API calls.
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically refresh cache when expired by fetching fresh data.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cache misses gracefully by fetching data and caching it.
- **FR-006**: Cache MUST be invalidated or refreshed when external data sources indicate changes, or upon admin request via API endpoint.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cached Model Data**: Represents the models information retrieved from external API, including model ID, name, description, and pricing details. Cached data should maintain the same structure as the original API response.
