# Implementation Plan: Enable Cache on Backend Side

**Branch**: `004-enable-cache-on` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: /specs/004-enable-cache-on/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from /specs/004-enable-cache-on/spec.md

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement in-memory caching for backend API responses with 5-minute expiration to improve performance by reducing external API calls and serving cached data for repeated requests.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js with Express  
**Primary Dependencies**: express, axios, node-cache  
**Storage**: In-memory cache using node-cache  
**Testing**: Jest  
**Target Platform**: Server-side backend  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Faster response times, reduced external API load  
**Constraints**: 5-minute cache expiration, single-instance deployment  
**Scale/Scope**: Handle repeated requests efficiently, support for models API endpoints

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] Responsive Design: N/A (backend only, no UI impact)
- [x] Performance Optimization: Caching directly improves performance by reducing API calls
- [x] Security First: Cache does not introduce security risks, data remains secure
- [x] User-Centric Experience: Faster responses improve user experience
- [x] Scalability and Maintainability: Modular cache service maintains code quality

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (frontend + backend detected)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Caching library choice: node-cache vs alternatives
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Memory usage considerations

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for Node.js backend caching"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for node-cache in Express applications"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use node-cache for in-memory caching
   - Rationale: Simple, no external dependencies, suitable for single-instance
   - Alternatives considered: Redis (overkill for single-instance), memory-cache (less maintained)

**Output**: research.md with all unknowns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - CachedModelData: id, name, description, pricing, timestamp
   - Cache metadata: expiration time, last updated

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - GET /api/models: Returns cached or fresh data
   - GET /api/models/:id: Returns cached or fresh model
   - POST /api/cache/invalidate: Admin endpoint to clear cache

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test cache hit/miss scenarios
   - Test expiration behavior
   - Test invalidation endpoint

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Cache hit: Return cached data instantly
   - Cache miss: Fetch and cache data
   - Expiration: Refresh after 5 minutes

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode` for your AI assistant
   - Add caching technology and patterns
   - Preserve existing context

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, AGENTS.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Cache service implementation task
- Model service cache integration task
- API route cache middleware task
- Contract test tasks for cache behavior
- Integration test tasks for user scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Cache service before integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
