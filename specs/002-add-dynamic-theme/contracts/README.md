# API Contracts: Add Dynamic Theme

## Overview
This feature is implemented entirely on the client-side and does not require any API endpoints or contracts.

## Rationale
- Theme switching is handled in the browser using CSS custom properties
- User preferences are stored in localStorage
- No server-side state management needed for theme functionality
- System theme detection uses browser APIs only

## No Contracts Generated
- No REST endpoints
- No GraphQL schemas
- No OpenAPI specifications

## Testing
Theme functionality will be tested through:
- Integration tests for theme switching
- Unit tests for theme context
- E2E tests for user interactions
- Visual regression tests for theme appearance

## Future Considerations
If theme preferences need to be synchronized across devices or stored server-side, API contracts would be added at that time.
