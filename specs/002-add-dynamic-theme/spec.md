# Feature Specification: Add Dynamic Theme

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-dynamic-theme`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add dynamic theme. Default use system theme"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the application to automatically use my system's theme preference (light or dark) by default, and allow me to switch themes dynamically if needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user's system is set to dark mode, **When** the application loads, **Then** it should display in dark theme.
2. **Given** the user's system is set to light mode, **When** the application loads, **Then** it should display in light theme.
3. **Given** the user manually selects a theme, **When** the application reloads, **Then** it should remember and apply the selected theme.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the system theme changes while the app is running? Should it update dynamically?
- How to handle systems that don't support theme detection?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect the user's operating system theme preference (light/dark).
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply the detected system theme as the default when the application starts.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a user interface to manually switch between light and dark themes.
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist the user's manual theme choice across browser sessions.
- **FR-005**: System MUST update the theme dynamically without requiring a page reload.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme**: Represents the visual appearance mode (light, dark, system default).
