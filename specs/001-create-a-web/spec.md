# Feature Specification: Create a Web App for Free AI Models

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a web app that show all free ai model by utilize openrouter api. There will be just a single page. The page will have search & list all the free models. The search result will be based on the received model list, not re-request the api again. The list is clickable & when clicked will be open bottomsheet dialog showing the detail of the selected ai model"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to view a list of all free AI models available through the OpenRouter API on a single web page, search through them without re-requesting the API, and click on any model to see its detailed information in a bottom sheet dialog.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the web page loads, **When** the OpenRouter API is called, **Then** all free AI models are fetched and displayed in a list
2. **Given** the list of models is loaded, **When** I enter a search term, **Then** the list is filtered to show only matching models without making a new API request
3. **Given** I see a model in the list, **When** I click on it, **Then** a bottom sheet dialog opens showing the detailed information of that model
4. **Given** the bottom sheet is open, **When** I close it, **Then** I return to the main list view

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the OpenRouter API is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle an empty list of free models?
- What occurs when the search yields no results?
- How is the user informed if a model's details cannot be loaded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch all free AI models from the OpenRouter API on initial page load
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the fetched models in a scrollable list format
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a search input field that filters the displayed list based on model names or descriptions
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow clicking on individual model items in the list
- **FR-005**: System MUST open a bottom sheet dialog when a model is clicked, displaying detailed information about the selected model
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure search filtering happens client-side without additional API requests

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AI Model**: Represents an AI model with attributes like ID, name, description, provider, and pricing information (specifically free models)
