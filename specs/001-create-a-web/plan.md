# Implementation Plan: Create a Web App for Free AI Models

**Branch**: `001-create-a-web` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: specs/001-create-a-web/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-web/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a single-page web application that fetches and displays all free AI models from the OpenRouter API, with search functionality and detailed model views in a bottom sheet. Backend uses Node.js, frontend uses React.js with Material UI.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+, React.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js, Axios, Material-UI, React Router
**Storage**: N/A (client-side only, API data cached)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: <2s initial load, <500ms search response
**Constraints**: Single page, no server-side rendering, client-side search
**Scale/Scope**: 100+ AI models, responsive design

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] Responsive Design: Ensure UI components are mobile-first and tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Performance Optimization: Implement lazy loading and monitor bundle sizes
- [ ] Security First: Use HTTPS, validate inputs, implement authentication
- [ ] User-Centric Experience: Include user testing in acceptance criteria
- [ ] Scalability and Maintainability: Use modular architecture and follow coding standards

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (frontend + backend detected)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
    - OpenRouter API integration patterns
    - Material-UI bottom sheet implementation
    - Client-side search optimization

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
    ```
    Task: "Research OpenRouter API models endpoint and response structure"
    Task: "Find best practices for Material-UI bottom sheet dialogs"
    Task: "Research efficient client-side search algorithms for large lists"
    Task: "Find patterns for responsive design with Material-UI"
    ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
    - Decision: Use Axios for API calls with error handling
    - Rationale: Simple, promise-based, good for React
    - Alternatives considered: Fetch API (native but less features)
    - Decision: Material-UI Drawer component for bottom sheet
    - Rationale: Built-in responsive behavior and accessibility
    - Alternatives considered: Custom CSS animations (more complex)

**Output**: research.md with all research completed

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
    - AI Model: id, name, description, provider, pricing, context_length
    - Validation: Free models only (pricing = 0)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
    - GET /api/models → fetch all models from OpenRouter
    - Use REST patterns with JSON response
    - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/models-api.yaml`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
    - Test GET /api/models returns array of model objects
    - Assert required fields present
    - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
    - Load page → fetch models → display list
    - Search → filter list → update display
    - Click model → open bottom sheet → show details

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
    - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode`
    - Add Node.js, React, Material-UI context
    - Preserve existing entries
    - Update recent changes

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/models-api.yaml, failing tests, quickstart.md, AGENTS.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract test for models API [P]
- Frontend component tasks [P]
- Backend API tasks
- Integration tests for user stories

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup: Project structure, dependencies
- Tests: Contract tests first
- Core: Backend API, then frontend components
- Integration: End-to-end flows

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
