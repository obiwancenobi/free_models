# Research Findings: Create a Web App for Free AI Models

## OpenRouter API Integration
- **Decision**: Use Axios for HTTP requests with interceptors for error handling
- **Rationale**: Provides promise-based API, automatic JSON parsing, and easy error handling for React applications
- **Alternatives considered**: Native fetch API (simpler but less features), SuperAgent (similar to Axios but less popular)

## Material-UI Bottom Sheet Implementation
- **Decision**: Use Material-UI Drawer component with anchor="bottom"
- **Rationale**: Built-in responsive behavior, accessibility features, and consistent with Material Design
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom CSS animations (more flexible but requires more code), react-spring (animation library but adds complexity)

## Client-Side Search Optimization
- **Decision**: Implement fuzzy search using Fuse.js library
- **Rationale**: Handles typos, provides ranking, and performs well with 100+ items
- **Alternatives considered**: Simple string includes (fast but no fuzzy matching), lodash filter (basic but less features)

## Responsive Design Patterns
- **Decision**: Use Material-UI Grid and breakpoints for responsive layout
- **Rationale**: Consistent with Material-UI ecosystem, handles mobile/tablet/desktop automatically
- **Alternatives considered**: CSS Grid/Flexbox manually (more control but more code), Bootstrap (different design system)

## State Management
- **Decision**: Use React useState and useEffect for component state
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for single-page app with API data, no complex state sharing needed
- **Alternatives considered**: Redux (overkill for this scope), Context API (unnecessary complexity)

## Performance Optimization
- **Decision**: Implement React.memo for list items and lazy loading for images
- **Rationale**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves initial load time
- **Alternatives considered**: No optimization (simple but may lag with large lists), virtualization (premature optimization)

## Error Handling
- **Decision**: Display user-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Rationale**: Improves user experience when API fails or network issues occur
- **Alternatives considered**: Silent failures (poor UX), technical error messages (confusing for users)

## Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for API calls
- **Rationale**: Covers critical paths without over-testing simple UI components
- **Alternatives considered**: Full E2E tests (slower and more brittle), no tests (risky for production)
