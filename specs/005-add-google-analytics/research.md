# Research: Google Analytics Integration

## GA4 Integration in React Applications

**Decision**: Use react-ga4 library for GA4 integration
**Rationale**: Official Google-supported library, React-specific hooks and components, minimal bundle size impact (~2KB gzipped), automatic page view tracking with React Router integration
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct gtag script: More manual setup, potential for errors, harder to integrate with React lifecycle
- Other libraries (react-gtm, gatsby-plugin-google-analytics): Less official, potential maintenance issues

## Custom Event Tracking Patterns

**Decision**: Use GA4 event naming conventions with custom parameters
**Rationale**: Standardized event structure, allows for detailed analytics without personal data, supports conversion tracking
**Implementation Approach**:
- Page views: Automatic via react-ga4
- Custom events: Track user interactions (search, model_select, theme_toggle) with relevant parameters
- Event structure: {action: 'search', category: 'engagement', label: search_term}

## Handling GA Blocking

**Decision**: Implement graceful degradation with error boundaries
**Rationale**: Ad blockers and privacy extensions are common, app must continue functioning without GA
**Strategies**:
- Wrap GA calls in try-catch blocks
- Check if gtag is available before sending events
- No user-facing errors when GA fails
- Fallback to console logging in development

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Lazy load GA script and defer initialization
**Rationale**: Minimize impact on initial page load, comply with performance goals
**Implementation**:
- Load react-ga4 after initial render
- Use React.lazy for GA components if needed
- Monitor bundle size impact

## Privacy Compliance

**Decision**: Focus on app behavior analytics only
**Rationale**: Avoid personal data collection, comply with privacy regulations without opt-out complexity
**Scope**: Track page views, user interactions, feature usage - no user IDs, personal info, or sensitive data
