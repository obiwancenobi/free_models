# Feature Specification: Add Google Analytics Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-google-analytics`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add google analytics to track all possible events & views"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site administrator, I want to track all user interactions and page views on the website using Google Analytics so that I can gain insights into user behavior, popular features, and areas for improvement.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits any page on the website, **When** the page loads, **Then** a page view event is automatically sent to Google Analytics.
2. **Given** a user performs a search, **When** they submit the search query, **Then** a custom event is tracked with the search term.
3. **Given** a user selects a model from the list, **When** they click on a model card, **Then** a custom event is tracked with the model ID.
4. **Given** a user toggles the theme, **When** they click the theme toggle button, **Then** a custom event is tracked indicating the theme change.
5. **Given** a user interacts with any clickable element (buttons, links), **When** they click it, **Then** a custom event is tracked with relevant details.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Google Analytics is blocked by an ad blocker or privacy extension?
- How does the system handle users who opt out of tracking?
- What if the GA script fails to load due to network issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate Google Analytics 4 (GA4) into the frontend application to enable tracking.
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically track page views for all routes and pages in the application.
- **FR-003**: System MUST track custom events for user interactions including but not limited to searches, model selections, theme toggles, and general button clicks.
- **FR-004**: System MUST include relevant parameters in tracked events (e.g., search terms, model IDs, event categories).
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle scenarios where Google Analytics is unavailable or blocked, without disrupting user experience.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure tracking focuses only on app behavior analytics without collecting personal user data.
