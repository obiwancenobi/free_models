# API Contracts

## Overview
The Google Analytics integration is client-side only and does not introduce new API endpoints or contracts. All tracking data is sent directly to Google Analytics servers using their measurement protocol.

## No Contracts Required
- No backend API changes needed
- No new endpoints for GA configuration
- Tracking is handled entirely in the frontend

## External Dependencies
- Google Analytics Measurement Protocol (GA4)
- No application-specific contracts to maintain
