# Implementation Plan: Add Google Analytics Tracking

**Branch**: `005-add-google-analytics` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: [specs/005-add-google-analytics/spec.md](specs/005-add-google-analytics/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/arif.ariyan/Documents/Development/fullstack/free_models/specs/005-add-google-analytics/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Integrate Google Analytics 4 into the React frontend to automatically track page views and custom events for user interactions (searches, model selections, theme toggles), ensuring no personal data collection and graceful handling of blocked trackers, using existing React framework without additional dependencies.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (React 18 for frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: React, React Router, existing frontend dependencies (no new additions)
**Storage**: N/A (GA handles its own storage)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library (existing)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and mobile)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Minimal impact on page load (<50ms additional load time)
**Constraints**: No personal user data collection, graceful degradation when GA blocked, comply with privacy best practices
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page React application with existing routing and components

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] Responsive Design: GA tracking works across all devices without UI changes
- [x] Performance Optimization: Minimal bundle impact, lazy load GA script if needed
- [x] Security First: GA uses secure HTTPS connections, no user data exposure
- [x] User-Centric Experience: Tracking provides insights for better UX, graceful degradation
- [x] Scalability and Maintainability: Modular GA integration, follows existing code patterns

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (frontend + backend detected)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - GA4 integration patterns in React
   - Custom event tracking implementation
   - Ad blocker handling strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research GA4 integration in React applications"
   Task: "Find best practices for custom event tracking in web apps"
   Task: "Research graceful degradation when GA is blocked"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use react-ga4 library for integration
   - Rationale: Official Google library, minimal bundle impact, existing React ecosystem
   - Alternatives considered: gtag script directly, other analytics libraries

**Output**: research.md with integration approach documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Event: type (page_view, custom), parameters (optional)
   - No persistent storage required

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - No new API endpoints required
   - GA integration is client-side only

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - No contract tests needed

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Page view tracking test
   - Custom event tracking test
   - Ad blocker handling test

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode` for your AI assistant
   - Add GA4 integration context
   - Preserve existing entries
   - Update recent changes

**Output**: data-model.md, quickstart.md, updated AGENTS.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data model, quickstart)
- GA setup task
- Component tracking tasks for each interaction type
- Test tasks for verification
- Integration tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup GA configuration first
- Then implement tracking in components
- Tests last to validate

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
